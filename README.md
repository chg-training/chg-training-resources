# Centre for Human Genetics Training Resources

This website contains training resources in genomics, bioinformatics and statistics developed at
the [Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. The
resources underpin the [training programmes](https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/study) at the centre, but
they may be useful to others so we are making them available here.
