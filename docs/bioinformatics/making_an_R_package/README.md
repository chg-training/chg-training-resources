# Making an R or python package

Welcome!  This tutorial assumes you have worked through the [Analysing gene annotation in R or python](../programming_with_gene_annotations3/README.md) tutorial first.  If so, you have a fully-fledged function called `read_gff()` that can read data from a [GFF file](../programming_with_gene_annotations3/002_What_gene_annotation_data_looks_like.md).

Let's now turn the function into an R package (or python module.)

To get started, go [here](./making_a_package.md).
