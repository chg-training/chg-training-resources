# Functions

So far so good - you can create variables and do computations.  To do really useful things, though, you need to use
**functions**.

In fact we've seen a few already: we used the `seq()`, `sum()` and `plot()` functions on [this page](vectors.md).

These illustrate the general form for using a function, which is:
```
function_name_goes_here( function arguments go here )
```

The function does some computation, based on its *arguments* in the brackets, and 'returns' its result.

## Examples

### Square roots
For example let's compute the square root of 1,000:
```
> sqrt(1000)
```
Here `sqrt` is the function name and `1000` is the function argument.

### Trigonometry

Or we could compute the sine of an angle:
```
> sin( pi/4 )
```
(The angle is expressed in radians, so `pi/2` means 45 degreees.)

## Functions with more than one argument

If the function takes two or more arguments, seperate them with commas:
```
> rep( 2, 5 )
[1] 2 2 2 2 2
```

**Note.** The `rep()` function stands for 'repeat'.  It repeats its first argument as many times as its second argument.

### Many values make light work

Functions, just like everything else, work on vectors.  For example let's generate a sine curve:
```
> x = seq( from = 0, to = 2*pi, by = 0.01 )
> y = sin(x)
> print(y)
```

and plot it:
```
> plot( x, y, type = 'l' )
```

## Named arguments

These examples also illustrate another feature of functions: **named arguments**. In this case `plot()` has an argument
named `type` which you can specify by giving its name.  Here, `type='l'` tells it to draw the result as a line.  

:::tip Question
What do you get if you don't include the `type='l'` argument?
:::

`plot()` actually has about a zillion arguments, but they all have names and most of them have **default values**, so
you only have to specify the ones you want to change.  For example another argument is `xlab` which specifies the x axis
label:
```
> plot( x, y, type = 'l', xlab = "Angle in radians" )
```

:::tip Challenge

Give the plot a sensible y axis label (`ylab`) as well.  And also get rid of the 'box' round the outside by setting the 'box type' to 'n' (`bty='n'`).

:::

## Generating random numbers

There are loads of other functions. For example we could **generate some random numbers** between 0 and 1 using
`runif()`:
```
> runif( n = 10 )
 [1] 0.7972164 0.6796878 0.3802085 0.8871665 0.0827587 0.6847181 0.5019356 0.5859209
 [9] 0.5115309 0.1100913
```
(You'll get a different values of course - they're random.)

A natural thing to do with random numbers is **histogram** them:
```
> x = runif( n = 100 )
> hist( x )
```

Or we could compute their *mean* or *average*:
```
> mean(x)
```

## Formatting strings

A very useful function is `sprintf()` which can be used to format numbers into strings.
For example to convert the number 5 to a string:
```
> sprintf( "%d", 5 )
```

The first argument is the **format string**, which here uses '%d' to say 'format a decimal integer here'.  
The other arguments are the values to be formatted.

`sprintf()` is useful to do general formatting.  For example, to list some filenames:

```
> sprintf( "/path/to/images/image%d.jpg", 1:10 )
```

Or to print out some diagnostics:
```
> n = 10
> k = 5
> sprintf( "There are %d ways to choose %d objects from a set of %d.", choose(n,k), k, n )
```


## Getting help

At this point, you may be wondering how you find out what a function does or what its arguments are. This where the
help system comes in.

E.g. let's use the help function to find out what `runif` does:

```
> ?runif
```

You'll see that `runif` is one of several functions for dealing with 'uniform' distributions (that is, where all values
in a range are equally likely).  And it has some other arguments that can be used to alter how it behaves. 

:::tip Question

Have a look at the documentation now and see if you can make sense of it.  How would you use `runif` to simulate 10
random numbers between 1000 and 2000?

:::

R help files are a bit of a mixed bag - they tend to have lots of details, but aren't always easy to read.  Still they are a good first port of call when you want to figure something out.  If still confused, a web search might also help.

Another way to search the help is with the double question mark form:

`> ??runif`

This will show you anything in the documentation that matches 'runif' or something close to it - a lot of results!
Somewhere in that list will be `stats::Uniform` which is the page we were just looking at.

:::tip Question

Look up the documentation for `sin()`, `exp()`, `log()`, or `sqrt()`
How could you plot the cosine of an angle, the exponential or logarithm or square root of a number?
Make sure you understand how this works.

## Writing your own functions

Everything we're doing here is done by **calling built-in functions** to compute or plot some values.  Built-in
functions are great!  But what if you want your own?

Well, this is easy too.  For example, let's write a function that converts a string to lower case, and then repeats it
twenty times:

```
> repeat_it = function( a_string ) {
	rep( tolower( a_string ), 20 )
}
```

Our function uses the `tolower()` built-in function to convert the case, and the `rep()` built-in function (read its help!) to repeat the string.  Try it out:
```
> repeat_it( "Repeat this!" )
```

Of course this function is silly - what if we want to repeat it 100 times instead?  Let's give the function a
`number_of_repeats` argument:
```
> repeat_it = function( a_string, number_of_repeats = 20 ) {
	rep( tolower( a_string ), number_of_repeats )
}
```

:::tip Question

Make sure you know how to call this function to repeat a string (say) twice or a hundred times.  
What happens if you repeat a million times?

:::

Functions like this work just like built-in functions, but you get to write them yourself.  They are defined using the
`function` keyword followed by a list of arguments inside brackets `()`.  The **body* of the function (i.e. the code it
runs) goes straight afterwards, in between curly braces `{}`.  Then the function returns the value of the last statement.

## Example: the logistic function

Let's use our skills to plot the **logistic function**.  It maps the real numbers into [0,1] and is defined as

$$
x \mapsto \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}
$$

In R we can define it as:
```
> logistic = function(x) {
	exp(x) / ( 1 + exp(x) )
}
```

:::tip Challenge

Plot the logistic function over a range from -5 to 5.

**Hint.**  Create a variable `x` with a range of values from -5 to 5 using the `seq()` function.  Then create a variable
`y` with the values of the logistic function applied to `x`.  Finally, plot `y` against `x`.

For **maximum kudos** your plot should be drawn as a line, have nice axis labels and no 'box' around it!  So it should look something like this:
