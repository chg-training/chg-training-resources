# The bayesian update

Let's try out Bayesian inference now, with the **Bayesian update-o-meterâ„¢**.

Imagine we're interested in a genetic variant with alleles **A** and **B**.  We sample some chromosomes from a large
population and use Bayes to estimate the allele frequency.  How does it work?

To find out, type your sample (a list of A's and B's into the data box below:)

What you are seeing is the **bayesian update**.  With each observation you make, Bayes' theorem computes its new belief (i.e. the posterior distribution) about the frequency of the 'B' allele.

Press 'reset' data (and/or 'reset prior') to get back to the start.
