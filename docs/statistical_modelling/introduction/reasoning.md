# Statistics is reasoning with uncertainty

I read the above title [on the internet](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/03/30/reasoning-under-uncertainty/).  I
think it sums up well what statistics actually is about.

Another way you could put it is that statistics is about **making inferences when we have incomplete information**.
After all

- "making inferences" is the same thing as reasoning.
- "having incomplete information" is the same thing as being uncertain.

In the next sections we will investigate how this uncertainty is handled and quantified in statistics.
