# Looking at insertions and deletions

The variants above are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - or rather multiple nucleotide
polymorphisms (MNPs) since several come together.  

What about other types of variation?

:::tip Challenge

Scroll around a bit and see if you can find a deletion or insertion variant - what do these look like?

:::


If stuck, try looking around the gene [`PF3D7_0220300`](https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/search?q=PF3D7_0220300).  What
read evidence supports this deletion?

Or look around the *PfCSP* gene again (`PF3D7_0304600`) - can you see anything odd here?

**Note.** Insertions look like purple bars in IGV.  Can you find any of these?
