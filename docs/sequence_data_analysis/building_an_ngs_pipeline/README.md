# A sequence data pipelining challenge!

Welcome!  Go to the [introduction](./Introduction.md) to get started.

:::tip Note

This tutorial is for people with some background in bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing.
It focusses on building a robust pipeline to process NGS reads using
[snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). To complete it you will need to have at
least some experience working with the UNIX command-line, and basic knowledge of the the steps
needed to process NGS data.

For background on NGS data and how to process it, please see the
[introduction to NGS
tutorial](/sequence_data_analysis/introduction_to_next_generation_sequencing_data_analysis/).
