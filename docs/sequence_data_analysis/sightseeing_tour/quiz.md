# Play 'guess the dataset'

Ok now you are expert in different types of data - it's time to test yourself.

To get started

1. first select all the tracks on the left and click 'Remove Track', to get rid of the existing data tracks.

2. Next I suggest starting by pointing your IGV session at gene `SPHK2` - (Sphingosine Kinase 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPHK2), which "mediates many cellular processes including migration, proliferation and apoptosis, and also plays a role in several types of cancer by promoting angiogenesis and tumorigenesis"

:::tip Note
(You can also look elsewhere in the genome of course.  But remember these data are only present in a [limited set of gene regions](./README.md).

3. Lastly, point your web browser at this folder:
```

```

:::tip Challenge

For each dataset from `1.bam` to `7.bam`, decide what type of data it is.  Is it -

A. Illumina short-read genome sequence data?
B. Illumina short-read RNA-seq data?
C. Illumina short-read ATAC-seq data?
D. Pacbio long-read genome sequence data?
E. Pacbio long-read RNA-seq data?
F. Nanopore long-read genome sequence data?
G. Illumina short-read sequencing of 10X 'linked read' molecules?

Good luck!
