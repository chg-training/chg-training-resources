# New! Dataset G: long-read RNA-seq

**Dataset G URL**:
```

```

:::caution Warning

A reminder that all data in this sightseeing tour is included strictly for training purposes - it is **not**
publicly-available data. Please do not share outside this course.
Contact me (Gavin Band) if you have any queries about this.

:::

Dataset G is **long-read transcriptomic data** from CD4+ T cells, i.e. ['T helper' cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell).
It was generated using an experimental approach similar to MAS-seq on the Pacbio platform.

**Question** How does pacbio data differ from the [Illumina RNA-seq data](./dataset_d.md)?
