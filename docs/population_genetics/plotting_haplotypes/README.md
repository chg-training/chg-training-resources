# Visualising haplotypes in R

In this page you will load up some real haplotype data (from the 1000 Genomes Project) and plot it in R.

Start by downloading the file `GWD_30x_calls.filtered.tsv.gz` from [this folder](https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/bioinformatics/training/gms/data/) and loading into R:
```r
gwd = readr::read_tsv( "https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/bioinformatics/training/gms/data/GWD_30x_calls.filtered.tsv.gz" )

print(gwd)
```

Have a look at the data.  The data consists of genotype calls for 112 'Gambian from the Western Division' individuals
from the recent high-coverage sequencing of [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org) samples.

It has data for >30,000 biallelic SNPs (in rows) and the samples in columns.

:::tip Note

If you want to see how this data was generated - follow the [Variant calling and imputation practical](/sequence_data_analysis/variant_calling_and_imputation/README.md).

This data comes from a region of chromosome 19 including the genes *GRIN2D* (which is associated with a number of [neurodevelopmental disorders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK582335/)) and *FUT2* (which encodes [secretor status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretor_status)).

:::

##Â Plotting the haplotypes

Let's plot this data now.  To start, let's turn the genotypes themselves into a matrix.
If you look at the data you'll see the first five columns are variant metadata, so let's get the rest:
```r
GT = as.matrix( gwd[,5:ncol(gwd)])
```

A simple way to plot is to use `image()`.  First we'll throw out monomorphic and rare variants:

```r
frequencies = rowSums(GT) / ncol(GT)
w = which( frequencies > 0 & frequencies < 1 )
GT = GT[w,]
metadata = gwd[w,1:4]
```

Let's first get the number of SNPs and haplotypes in the data:
```r
L = nrow(GT) # number of SNPs
N = ncol(GT) # number of haplotypes
```
and plot:
```r
image(
	GT,
	x = 1:L,
	y = 1:N,
	xlab = "SNPs",
	ylab = "Chromosomes"
)
```

![img](images/haplotypes.png)

Cool!  

But there are three ways we could improve it - we'll try two of these.

First, we could order the haplotypes (i.e. grouping similar haplotypes) which will help to bring out the 'haplotype structure'.  (We'll do this in a moment.)

Second, instead of plotting reference and non-reference alleles, it would be nice to plot ancestral and non-ancestral (i.e. 'derived') alleles.  Then we'd be looking at mutations directly.  (We'll skip this for now.)

## Plotting genes

The third thing it would be nice to do is plot genes on there... let's try this now.  First load the genes.

:::caution Note
The data above is in **build 37** coordinates.  So you will need to get the [build 37 version](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_47lift37.html) of the gencode files for this.
Download the b37 version of the gff file now, for example by:
```
curl -O https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_47/GRCh37_mapping/gencode.v47lift37.annotation.gff3.gz
```
and remember where it is saved.
:::

Now load the genes into R:
```r
genes = gmsgff::read_gff( "/path/to/gencode.v47lift37.annotation.gff3.gz", extra_attributes = c( "gene_name", "gene_type" ) )
```

:::tip Note
To load the data like this, you have to have the `read_gff()` function.  Either you have [written your own](https://chg-training.github.io/chg-training-resources/bioinformatics/programming_with_gene_annotations3/), or else you can install my version from the `gmsgff` package.  To install that now, try:
```
install.packages(
    "https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/bioinformatics/training/gms/code/R/gmsgff.tgz",
    repos = NULL,
    type = "source"
)
```

Plotting genes from gff is also nontrivial so I've written a function to do it - find it in [this file](https://github.com/chg-training/chg-training-resources/blob/main/docs/population_genetics/plotting_haplotypes/code/plot_gff.R).  If you download that file, you can either paste it into your R session or load it using `source()`:
```r
source( 'plot_gff.R')
```
:::

Let's plot a multi-panel plot with the haplotypes on top and the genes underneath. Because the haplotypes are plotted in
SNP index positions, we'll also need some join-y segments to show us where they are. For customised plots like this, you
usually need to go low level.  This tutorial uses base R graphics to do this, but the techniques should apply to other
systems as well.

This is  graphics so I'm going to make a layout for the plot - with the genes below the sequences.
This will be a multi-panel plot, which takes a bit of care.
I've found the best way to do control multi-panel plots is to

1. get rid of the built-in plot margins, and
2. Instead control the margins as rows in the layout of panels.

In R we can do that by creating a plot layout matrix with `0`'s in the rows and columns that are not plotted in.  Let's try now:

```
# First remove R's built-in plot margins...
par( mar = c( 0, 0, 0, 0 ))

# ...and generate a multi-panel layout matrix
layout.matrix = matrix(
	c(
		0, 0, 0, # top margin
		0, 1, 0, # haplotypes
		0, 0, 0,
		0, 2, 0, # linking lines
		0, 0, 0,
		0, 3, 0, # genes
		0, 0, 0  # bottom margin
	),
	byrow = T,
	ncol = 3
)
print( layout.m )
```

The layout() function now creates a multi-panel figure:
```
layout(
	layout.matrix,
	widths = c( 0.1, 1, 0.1 ),
	heights = c( 0.1, 1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1 )
)
```

Now we plot the panels in the order they appear in the layout:

```
# Plot 1: the haplotypes
image(
	GT,
	x = 1:L,
	y = 1:N,
	xlab = "SNPs",
	ylab = "Chromosomes"
)
```

For the middle panel, let's make a blank plot, and then put some line segments on.
I like three-segmented line segments here, so that's what I'll do!

```
# Plot 2: the joining segments
xlim = range( metadata$position )
blank.plot( xlim = xlim, ylim = c( 0, 1 ), xaxs = 'i' )
xs = seq( from = xlim[1], to = xlim[2], length = nrow( metadata ))
ys = c( 0, 0.25, 0.75, 1 )
segments(
	x0 = metadata$position, x1 = metadata$position,
	y0 = ys[1], y1 = ys[2]
)
segments(
	x0 = metadata$position, x1 = xs,
	y0 = ys[2], y1 = ys[3]
)
segments(
	x0 = xs, x1 = xs,
	y0 = ys[3], y1 = ys[4]
)
```

Finally for the last panel we'll plot the genes:
```
# Plot 3: the genes
plot_gff(
	genes %>% filter( end >= xlim[1] & start <= xlim[2] & type %in% c( "gene", "transcript", "exon", "CDS" )),
	region = list( chromosome = 'chr19', start = min(metadata$position), end = max( metadata$position ))
)
```

Phew!  That's quite a bit to type so I've put that all together, with some extra tweaks, into a function which you can find [here](https://github.com/chg-training/chg-training-resources/blob/main/docs/population_genetics/plotting_haplotypes/code/plot_haplotypes.R).  Download that file, source it by typing...
```r
source( 'plot_haplotypes.R' )
```

...and let's try it:
```
region = list(
	chromosome = 'chr19',
	start = 48146028,
	end = 49255722
)
plot_haplotypes(
	GT,
	metadata,
	genes,
	region = region
)
```

Let's also zoom in a bit to see the haplotypes around *GRIN2D*:
```
FUT2.region = list(
	chromosome = 'chr19',
	start = 49199228 - 50000,
	end = 49209208 + 50000
)
plot_haplotypes(
	GT,
	metadata,
	genes,
	region = FUT2.region
)
```

...or a slightly larger region around *GRIN2D**:
```
GRIN2D.region = list(
	chromosome = 'chr19',
	start = 48896925 - 100000,
	end = 48948188 + 100000
)
plot_haplotypes(
	GT,
	metadata,
	genes,
	region = GRIN2D.region
)
```

Very [hapmap-esque](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04226)!.

## Ordering the haplotypes

Haplotypes plotted like that look very noisy - and not surprisingly, since the individuals are essentially in random order.

To try to make sense of them, let's use a simple approach to order the haplotypes in the region -  [hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering).

In R we can do this by first constructing a **distance matrix** and then using `hclust()` to cluster it.  Let's try now - we'll cluster by SNPs near the FUT2 gene:

```r
wNearGRIN2D = which( metadata$position >= GRIN2D.region$start & metadata$position <= GRIN2D.region$end )
distance = dist(
	t(GT[wNearGRIN2D,]),
	method = "manhattan"
)
```

Here we've used 'manhattan' distance, that is, the distance between two haplotypes is the number of mutational
differences between them.

:::tip Note

The `t()` part is needed around GT, otherwise we will be clustering SNPs instead of samples.  (You'll know if you got
this wrong because the output will be enormous below.

:::

You can see what the distance matrix looks like by converting to a matrix:
```r
as.matrix(distance)[1:10,1:10]
```

You should see something like this:

```

Now let's cluster and order them using `hclust()`:
```r
sample_order = hclust( distance )$order
```

Let's plot again - this time ordering the columns (haplotypes) in the data:
```r
plot_haplotypes(
	GT[,sample_order],
	metadata,
	genes,
	region = GRIN2D.region
)
```

:::tip Note

Wouldn't it be better to put that sorting code into a function?  It would!

```r
order_haplotypes <- function( haplotypes, metadata, region ) {
	wInRegion = which( metadata$position >= region$start & metadata$position <= region$end )
	distance = dist(
		t(haplotypes[wInRegion,]),
		method = "manhattan"
	)
	return( hclust( distance )$order )
}

```

Feel free to explore other regions within the data.

## The frequency of variants

How much variation is there?  Here are a few ways to look at it.

First we could look at the frequencies of all the variants in the data:

```r
par( mfrow = c( 1, 1 ), mar = c( 4.1, 4.1, 4.1, 4.1 ))
frequencies = rowSums( GT ) / ncol( GT )
hist(
	frequencies,
	breaks = 25,
	xlab = "Alt allele frequency",
	ylab = "Count",
	main = "Site frequency spectrum"
)
```

![img](images/sfs.png)

This picture is typical - **most variant alleles are rare**, and only a few are common.

:::tip Note

These are the frequencies at **variable sites** only.  If we computed at every site, there would be an even bigger spike
at zero - counting all the sites that are not variable between people in our data. (How many of these are there in this
region?)

:::

This picture is for *alternate* alleles (versus reference alleles).  A better plot would show the frequencies of
 **derived** alleles (i.e. those that have arisen trhough mutation compared to the common ancestor).  To do that, we
 would need a call of the ancestral allele - which we haven't loaded right now.  So instead let's plot hte **folded site frequency spectrum**:

```r
hist(
	pmin( frequencies, 1 - frequencies ),
	breaks = 25,
	xlab = "Minor allele frequency",
	ylab = "Count",
	main = "Folded site frequency spectrum"
)

```

![img](images/folded_sfs.png)


## Computing diversity

Another natural metric is to measure 'how much variation' there is by computing the average evolutionary distances between haplotypes. The simplest way is just to count the number of mutations that differ between each pair of haplotypes, on average across pairs.

The idea is that (ignoring recombination for a moment) - mutations that seperate two samples represent those that have occurred since their most recent common ancestor.  Roughtly speaking the number of mutations 'counts' the evolutionary distance between the haplotypes.  A natural metric is thus **number of pairwise differences** between the two haplotypes.

Let's see how distantly related the haplotypes are on average, by computing the  **average number of pairwise
differences** between different haplotypes - also known as **nucleotide diversity** - now. To do this we'll write a
function which loops over all pairs of haplotypes in the data.

:::tip Note

How many pairs of distinct haplotypes are there?  The answer is of course the number of ways of drawing two things from $N$ things - known as '$N$ choose 2':

$$
N\quad\text{choose}\quad2 = \frac{N\cdot(N-1)}{2} \\

$$

...also known as the 2nd diagonal in pascal's triangle:
```
N
0           1
1         1   1   â
2       1   2   1
3     1   3   3   1
4   1   4   6   4   1
          etc.
```

In R, you can  compute this using the `choose()` function - or just do `N*(N-1)/2` as above, which is what I've done in
the function below.

:::

and so on.  

```r
average_number_of_pairwise_differences = function(
	haplotypes
) {
	N = ncol(haplotypes)
	total = 0
	# Sum over all pairs
	# There are of course much faster ways to do this!
	for( i in 1:(N-1) ) {
		for( j in (i+1):N ) {
			a = haplotypes[,i]
			b = haplotypes[,j]
			total = total + sum( a != b )
		}
	}
	# Divide by the total number of pairs
	return( total / (N*(N-1)/2))
}

average_number_of_pairwise_differences( GT )
```

```
1811.239
```

So haplotypes differ by about 1800 mutations on average, across this 1.1Mb region - or about 1.6 mutations per kilobase.

## Challenge questions

Here are some challenges:

:::tip Challenge 1

Pick other genes in the region and make a version of the haplotype plot that shows all haplotypes, but the ordering is
based only on the SNPs in the gene, or a small region around it.

:::

:::tip Challenge 2

Do haplotypes carrying the alternate allele at the SNP `rs601338` (at `chr19:49206674` in *FUT2*), which determines secretor
status, look different from those that don't?  Try plotting just the haplotypes carrying each allele.

:::

::: Challenge 3

Similarly, if you've done the [genome-wide association study practical](../../genome_wide_association_studies/genome_wide_association_analysis/README.md) you found an association in the *FUT2* gene. Can you make a two-panel version of the haplotype plot, with the top panel being haplotypes that carry the alternate allele of this associated SNP, and the lower panel being haplotypes that don't?

**Hints**:

* You can look up the position of the lead GWAS SNPs in the `metadata` variable.  (Both datasets are in GRCh37 'build 37' coords.)

* You can get the genotypes for the SNP (of course) out of the `GT` matrix.

* Use `layout()` in R to make a two-panel plot, e.g.:
```r
layout( matrix( 1:2, ncol = 1 ))
```
and then plot the panels in order.

:::

Good luck!
